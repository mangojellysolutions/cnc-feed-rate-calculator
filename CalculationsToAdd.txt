Step per mm
$$

Get the lead screw pitch

Count the number of crests over one inch on the leadscrew to get no of crests (c) in my case 14
Divide 1 inch by c to get the lead screw pitch in my case 1/14 = 0.07142857142 inch per rev

Find out steps per inch
Divide steps per revolution of motor by the lead screw pitch - in my case no of steps per rev = 200 so 200/0.0714 = 2801.12 steps per inch

Convert to mm
no of steps per inch * (1 inch / 25.4mm) in my case 2801.12 * (1/25.4) = 110.280 steps/mm (steps per mm)

Multtiply the steps per mm by the microstepping configured on the board i.e x2 x4 x8 x16

no of steps/mm * micro stepping - for me 110.280 steps/mm * 2 = 220.560

GRBL x = $100 = 220.560
	y = $101
	z = $102 ???
